> "I was an ordinary person who studied hard" - Richard P.Feynman

## Brief introduction

I am **leeminhduc2**. My full name is **Lê Minh Đức**. You can call me **Đức, Duck,** or **Donald** which is my English name.

I'm currently a 2nd-year student in [University of Engineering and Technology - Vietnam National University](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/) .

My pronouns are **he/him** (Yes I'm 101% straight).

I enjoy competitive programming a lot. I've reached Master (>=2100 ratings) on Codeforces as seen [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/Gwen) .

I love playing Teamfight Tactics, Valorant and sometimes PUBG. Specifically, I reached Master tank in TFT for five consecutive sets (starting from set 10). You can check my account information [here](https://tactics.tools/player/vn/leeminhduc2) .

I'm looking forward to reaching Challenger in TFT and having a job as an AI Engineer (maybe).

## Why do I create this website ?

Well, I just want a place where I can share my personal thoughts, and also learn more about web design (with the help of Hugo ❤️).

My blog is also available in both English and Vietnamese (which is WiP).

## My achievements (to be updated)

- 3rd Prize in Vietnamese Olympiad in Informatics.
- 2 times 1st Prize in Lao Cai Olympiad in Informatics (2022,2023).
